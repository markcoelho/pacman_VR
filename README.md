This project was developed for the Interactive Virtual Reality Environments course, part of the Master’s Degree in Design and Multimedia at the University of Coimbra. The primary objective of the class was to reimagine a classic game in a virtual reality (VR) format. I chose Pac-Man—one of the most iconic and beloved games of all time—due to its timeless appeal and widespread recognition.

To bring this project to life, I used A-Frame, a web-based framework built on top of Three.js for creating 3D environments. A-Frame, combined with the Glitch platform, made it easy to prototype and deploy a functional VR experience quickly. The framework’s well-documented features and robust VR integration allowed for a smooth development process.

One of the key features I aimed to incorporate was arm-based locomotion, inspired by the movement mechanics in the popular VR game Gorilla Tag. This approach to movement not only adds a layer of fun and novelty but, in my opinion, also helps reduce motion sickness, compared to traditional joystick-based movement. By requiring players to move their arms to navigate the game world, the experience becomes more immersive and physically engaging.

The project is designed for home gamers equipped with a VR headset and controllers, along with an internet connection, making it accessible and easy to enjoy.
